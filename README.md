## Project Overview

### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the label CSV data to gain insights and perform analysis.
- Utilized various EDA techniques to explore the data and derive meaningful conclusions.

### Step 2: Pneumonia Detection using CNN and LSTM
The "pneumonia_detections" project aimed to detect pneumonia in human lungs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
- Initial accuracy: 56%
- Implemented a novel approach using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.
- Achieved a remarkable accuracy improvement, reaching 92%.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of innovative techniques in medical image analysis for disease detection.
